# RoomBookingBot
I made a bot that automatically makes a reservation in a meeting room in my university.

Some code such as the Twilio Text message code is commented out since it will not be able to be used if you don't generate a token and phone number of your own. Also all of the personal information such as my password has been removed from files. To be able to use this you need a Stockholm University student email and a password as well as another email persons student email since the reservations must be made by at least two people.

I'm using selenium for web scraping and interaction which requires you to install Chromedriver or correlating software to your browser for it to work.

I realize that not a lot of people will be able to make use of this program because of the limitations, but the primary idea with this repository is to show how I solved the evaluation of the avialable rooms etc, not to use the program in its current state.
